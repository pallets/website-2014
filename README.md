# Pallets website
Welcome to the Pallets Projects!

The Pallets Projects are a collection of Python web development libraries that were independently developed by Armin Ronacher and later used as the basis of the Flask microframework. Today the Pallets Projects are a community-driven organization with the goal to maintain and improve those libraries.
